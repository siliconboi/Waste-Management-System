The Problem statement

Waste management is a major challenge in India, and the country faces a number of problems in its waste management system, some of which include:
Lack of infrastructure: India has a limited number of waste management facilities, and the existing ones are often inadequate and outdated. This results in waste being dumped in open spaces, which leads to environmental pollution and health hazards.
Inadequate funding: Waste management in India is often underfunded, which results in a lack of resources for the implementation of effective waste management systems.
Poor waste collection and transportation: In many parts of India, waste collection and transportation systems are inadequate, leading to waste being left uncollected and causing environmental pollution.
Lack of public awareness: There is a lack of public awareness about the importance of proper waste management and the negative impact of mismanagement. This leads to the continued practice of unsanitary waste disposal methods.
Inefficient segregation and treatment of waste: In India, there is a lack of proper segregation of waste at the source, which results in mixed waste being sent to landfills. This makes it difficult to treat and dispose of waste in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Illegal dumping of hazardous waste: India is facing a major challenge of illegal dumping of hazardous waste, which can pose serious risks to human health and the environment.
Lack of proper policies and regulations: There is a lack of comprehensive national policies and regulations for waste management, which leads to inconsistent approaches to waste management across different states in the country.
In conclusion, India needs to address these challenges in order to develop an effective and sustainable waste management system that can protect the environment and public health.

Waste management is a crucial issue for cities, with a growing amount of waste being generated each day. The current waste management systems are often manual and inefficient, leading to issues such as waste being left uncollected, improper disposal of hazardous waste, and an overall negative impact on the environment. Moreover, the lack of proper communication between citizens and waste management service providers leads to waste pickup requests not being efficiently addressed.


2. Workflow of Zero:
We created a webapp using Javascript, MERN & Machine learning converted to JSON .
The model is trained to classify waste products into different categories.
These categories will inculcate a different network of kabadiwalas, scrapdealers, garbagepickers & so on.
Different category of commercial scrap or wastes, will attract different category of dealers.
As soon as our customer request pickup, aa SMS gets notified to the mobile phone of our connected partner walas, where they get the location & time of pickup.
Our customer gets cash for different scrap materials, also Zero coins for giving their garbage to us, with which they can get recyclabale items at a flat discount rate.
